        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Liam Del Banco and I am a First year student at University of California Riverside (UCR). I am a major in Theatre, Film, and Digital Production (TFDP) with a concentration in the Acting and Directing track. I went to International Polytechnic High school and completed my high school education there. In my education, I have been given many opportunities to learn and experience different helpful skills. My high school education has not only prepared me for basic uses of Google softwares (Ex: Google Docs, Google Slides, etc.), but also towards my abilities in public speaking and working with others in different varieties of projects.
<br><br>

        Beyond my education, I have had little job experiences. However, I have been involved in many volunteer activities because of my high school experiences in many different fields and job zones in a sense. Specifically being areas such as float decoration, game supervision, museum volunteer event work, online math tutoring, in person teacher assistant for elementary school, etc. These experiences within my education years have greatly benefited me in enhancing and teaching me more useful skills for my future life and career. Specifically that of learning communication skills. Mainly as all of these different volunteer experiences forced me to further develop and leave my comfort zone to help me better improve how I approach communicating with other people. Especially in terms of teaching and helping others understand through communication is what they had all focused upon. Overall, my job experience may not be as great, but my volunteer experiences have been much greater and have increased my abilities in communication with others for the purpose of informing or teaching.<br><br>

        Furthermore, as for my own field and major, TFDP or Acting or Directing, I have my own reasons and experiences that have influenced and helped me here. While as a whole I do have little experiences within this industry, I have further developed some of my own skills and interest in this field. For more background, my interest in the field had started with interest in animation content I grew up with as a kid. Primarily their stories (such as from actions like Teen Titans or SitComs I regularly watched with my parents). From there, my interest in cinema and movies was further supported by stories told by those such as Marvel or other more meaningful and impactful films (Such as Everything Everywhere All at Once). Many of these types of movies and shows greatly influenced my reasons for my interest in the field of film. Mainly to similarly try and create stories with meaning or to make people smile. As for my experiences, I have had a fair share of projects in my time in high school that had put me to the test in both editing and writing scripts for film or video projects. From there, I had taken much more lead on these projects and taken time to further pursue different tools and videos to learn more of the field itself. Overall, while I may have little current experiences in this industry, my interest and experiences I have had further pushed me into the field and further development of other useful skills (such as me having started to take acting classes).
